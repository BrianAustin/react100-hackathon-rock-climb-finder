## Find-a-Climb
This app delivers a list of rock climbs based on the city and state entered into the search bar. There are four optional parameters: 

 *Miles from Location (up to 200; default is 30)

 *Number of Climbs to Return (default is 50)

 *Minimum Difficulty

 *Maximum Difficulty

### Getting Started
To see a live version of the app, get yourself over to [this link on Heroku](https://ba-react100-find-a-climb.herokuapp.com/).

Should you wish to run this app on your machine, clone the project to your machine. Remember to run 'npm install'. Running 'npm start' will launch the build and then the local server. Depending on your browser and its security settings, you may need to allow what your browser will call "unsafe scripts" to run. This probably won't kill your machine, but I make no gaurantees. Computers are weird. The internet is weird.
